Install the script using PuTTY (SSH)
1. Connect to the router via SSH
Download and open PuTTY

Enter your router’s IP address (usually 192.168.1.1)

Click Open

Log in with:

Username: root
Password: (your OpenWrt admin password)

Download and install the script
In the PuTTY terminal, run the following commands:
cd /usr/bin
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilblogdicristiangallo/ZTE-MF286D-Testing-Network-Online/main/NetWatchWanNetwork.sh
chmod +x /usr/bin/NetWatchWanNetwork.sh

This downloads the script to /usr/bin/ and makes it executable.

Test the script manually: /usr/bin/NetWatchWanNetwork.sh

Enable automatic execution at startup using LuCI

Method: using rc.local via LuCI (web interface)
1. Access the LuCI web interface
Open your browser and go to http://192.168.1.1. Log in with your OpenWrt credentials.

2. Navigate to System → Startup
3. Scroll down to the "Local Startup" section
This section allows you to edit the /etc/rc.local file, which runs automatically during system boot.

4. Add the following line before the exit 0 line:

/usr/bin/NetWatchWanNetwork.sh &

 Example of the final result:
#!/bin/sh -e

/usr/bin/NetWatchWanNetwork.sh &

exit 0
